# **App Name**: FunctionFinder

## Core Features:

- Code Input: Input text area to paste the code snippet.
- Function Analysis: Generative AI to determine if a function to fetch dispensaryTypes collection or if id in type.id  also should be in dispensaryTypes collection has been written. The AI will leverage a code parsing tool, combined with any natural language comments to accomplish its analysis.
- Analysis Display: Clear display of analysis results, including whether the function exists, relevant code snippets, and explanation.

## Style Guidelines:

- The primary color is a calming blue (#5DADE2), inspired by the concept of clarity and insight in code analysis. It suggests trust and precision, which is important when providing feedback about code.
- The background color is a very light, desaturated blue (#F0F8FF), creating a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- The accent color is a complementary lavender (#A392CC), which adds a touch of creativity and differentiation, particularly useful for highlighting key elements or calls to action.
- A monospaced font for code display to maintain readability and alignment.
- Simple, clear icons for actions like 'Analyze' or status indicators.
- A clean and structured layout with clear separation of input and output areas.
