// This file is obsolete and has been removed.
// The single source of truth for types is now in `functions/src/types.ts`.
// Keeping this file might cause resolution issues during TypeScript compilation.
// To use types in the frontend, import them from the `lib/schemas` file instead.
// Example: import type { Dispensary } from '@/lib/schemas';
